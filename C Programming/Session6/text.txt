In a struct, an uninitialized array has to be the last element in order to save memory for it.

Inside an struct, no variable can be initialzied. In the main only.

Change the order of variables in a structure to save memory, the biggest 1st.

#pragma pack(1) allows lowest space saving, it is not preprosessive directive, 
and allows 1 byte space saving. Saves RAM, but reduces execution time. 
#pragma pack(2) force the compiler to reserve space in RAM by 2 bytes.
2 is faster than 1, increasing the number increases the speed

char x:3 allows the selection of only 3 bits for example

Typedef: Happens during compile time, syntax chack and text replacement.

Memory Acessing is done in 1 or 2 or 4 or 8 bytes at a time, done by compiler automatic.

(*p).variable1 is the same as p->variable1
